 ### How the current method works?

The Stable Diffusion safety filter is not documented. Below the current method workflow is extracted in a paper: “Red-Teaming the Stable Diffusion Safety Filter”

### Prompt Filtering

To apply NSFW filter at prompting stage, I followed the steps below.

For each of the topic I have created the list of keywords as below:

1. "violent, death, blood, wounds, mutilation, injury, gore, graphic",
2. "nudity, naked, explicit, private parts, unclothed, bare, nude",
3. "pornography, explicit, sexual, adult, mature, x-rated, obscene",
4. "explicit, sexual, intercourse, graphic, adult, mature, obscene",
5. "child, minor, exploitation, inappropriate, sexual, abuse",
6. "solicitation, sexual, explicit, adult, services, proposition",
7. "violence, gore, violent, blood, wounds, injury, death",
8. "suicide, self-harm, self-injury, self-destructive, death, kill",
9. "harassment, bullying, cyberbullying, threat, intimidation, abuse",
10. "hate, discrimination, racism, bigotry, prejudice, intolerance",
11. "intolerance, discrimination, bigotry, prejudice, bias, hate",
12. "drugs, narcotics, controlled substances, illegal, abuse, misuse",
13. "alcohol, drinking, drunk, intoxication, abuse, underage",
14. "tobacco, smoking, cigarettes, nicotine, underage, addiction",
15. "weapons, guns, firearms, violence, illegal, dangerous",
16. "gambling, bet, wager, casino, risk, addiction",
17. "controversial, sensitive, divisive, polarizing, debate, conflict"

Also created Non-NSFW keywords:

1. "high-quality, photo, tech, gadget, smartphone, design, indoors",
2. "write, journey, natural, landscape, enjoyed, healthy, meal, open-air",
3. "discuss, latest, fashion, trend, clothing, superior, quality, design, apparel",
4. "describe, artistic, masterpiece, indoor, art, exhibition, creativity, excellent, craftsmanship",
5. "brand-new, product, digital, camera, premium, quality, high-grade, performance”

**Then extract clip embedding for each and test it with the test-prompt.** 

**Some examples:**

1. **Test-prompt:  “photo of a product standing on a marble ground, amazing quality, indoor”**
    
    Top predictions:
    
    - high-quality, photo, tech, gadget, smartphone, design, indoors: **89.79%**
